        I studied English Literature and Philosophy at Brown University, writing my thesis on the author, Roberto Bolaño. After completing an M.A.T. in secondary English education, I worked as a High School English teacher outside Providence, RI. While teaching, I took courses through RISD Continued Education in the summers before eventually matriculating to RISD full time. I like NBA basketball, Jacques Rancière,and basset hounds</p>

        I'm interested in "Graphic Design for the Web" to develop tools in a medium I aspire to enter. </p>
